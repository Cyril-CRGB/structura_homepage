## Project description:
This website is designed for **my personal use**. 

'Structura' means 'structure' in Latin, and I believe structure is essential for growth. The talent of structuring is crucial to prevent an organization from stagnating. A good 'structure' is like the roots of a tree: they may not be visible, but they are vital.

'Heart' symbolizes 'health.' For an organization, 'cash' is like blood; it needs a strong system (accounts receivable) to receive and redistribute it (through investments) for the organization to thrive. 

'Tree' represents growth and productivity through its fruits. The right people, like branches, produce the right results."

## Features:
'fruits', on click gives away what i can do.
